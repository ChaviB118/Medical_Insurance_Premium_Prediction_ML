# Medical_Insurance_Premium_Prediction_ML
I completed this project as part of my Data Science and Machine Learning Internship with United Network of Professionals (UNP).

# About the project :
The objective of the project is to build a Machine Learning model to forecast annual medical insurance premium based on given customer data.

This project focused on creating statistical machine learning models that would help in predicting annual medical insurance premiums. It involved data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and various algorithms such as Multiple Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, SVM, Decision Trees, and Random Forest. The models were tested with different train : test split ratios to optimize performance. The project highlighted how machine learning can enhance accuracy and fairness in the insurance industry, while addressing challenges like bias and interpretability. The outcome emphasizes the growing potential of AI in transforming insurance premium prediction.
